              scatter plot, adverse effects seem to be rare in children. The
              dots become more concentrated after the age of 15. Until the age
              of 90, this concentration remains consistent, revealing that

              90. AFter that, the concentration disperses and less dots are
              found, though this can be attributed to life expectancy; since on
