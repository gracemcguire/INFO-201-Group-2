              scatter plot, adverse reactions seem to be rare in children. The

              of 90, this concentration remains consistent, revealing that
              adverse reactions are much more common between the ages of 15 and
              90. AFter that, the concentration disperses and less dots are
              found, though this can be attributed to life expectancy; since on
